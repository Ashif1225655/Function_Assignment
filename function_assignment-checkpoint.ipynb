    "# Using generators in Python offers several advantages over regular functions,\n",
    "# especially in scenarios involving large datasets or streams of data. \n",
    "# Here are the key benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Memory Efficiency\n",
    "# Generators produce items one at a time, meaning they do not store the entire sequence\n",
    "# in memory at once. This makes them very efficient for working with large datasets or \n",
    "# infinite sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: A regular function that generates a large list would consume a lot of memory,\n",
    "# but a generator produces values on demand, saving memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "def get_large_list(n):\n",

    "def generate_large_sequence(n):\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",

    "# a large amount of memory, whereas generate_large_sequence() will only generate one number\n",
    "# at a time, consuming much less memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Lazy Evaluation\n",
    "# Generators implement lazy evaluation, meaning values are produced only when they are needed.\n",
    "# This is particularly useful when working with streams of data (e.g., reading a file line by line),\n",
    "# infinite sequences, or real-time data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: Reading a large file line by line:\n",

    "# This way, the generator reads one line at a time, instead of loading the entire file into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Improved Performance\n",
    "# Because generators yield one value at a time, they can start producing output immediately,\n",
    "# instead of waiting for the entire function to execute. This improves performance,\n",
    "# especially when the entire result set is not needed at once.\n",

    "\n",
    "# map(function, iterable)\n",

    "# 10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python\n",
    "# In Python, the map(), reduce(), and filter() functions are used to process and manipulate sequences (like lists or tuples). Each of them serves a different purpose in functional programming. Here's the key difference between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. map() Function:\n",
    "# Purpose: map() applies a function to each item of an iterable (e.g., list, tuple) and returns a map object (which can be converted into a list, tuple, etc.).\n",
    "# Usage: Used when you want to transform or modify each element of a sequence based on a function.\n",
    "# Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "# map(function, iterable)\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "\n",

    "squares = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)\n",
    "print(list(squares))  \n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. filter() Function:\n",
    "# Purpose: filter() applies a function to each item of an iterable, and only items for which the function returns True are included in the result.\n",
    "# Usage: Used when you want to filter or select elements of an iterable based on a condition.\n",
    "# Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "# filter(function, iterable)\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "\n",

    "print(list(evens))  # Output: [2, 4, 6]\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. reduce() Function:\n",
    "# Purpose: reduce() applies a function cumulatively to the items of an iterable, reducing the iterable to a single value.\n",
    "# Usage: Used when you want to perform a cumulative operation (e.g., sum, product) on a sequence. It is part of the functools module, so you need to import it first.\n",
